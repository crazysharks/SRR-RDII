## 🎬 Result Demonstration

We provide a short video demonstrating our system's spectral reflectance reconstruction and relighting results.  
[👉 Click to watch the video](./demo/demo_result.mp4)

> The video illustrates:  
> - Spectral reflectance recovery from RGB inputs  
> - Dual-illumination acquisition setup  
> - Dynamic relighting with estimated reflectance

You can also view it directly in your browser if your GitHub settings allow video preview.
